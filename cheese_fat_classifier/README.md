# Cheese Fat Classification Machine Learning Project

## Objective
Build a supervised machine-learning model to classify cheese samples as **low-fat** or **high-fat** based on chemical composition features.

## Dataset
Public cheese composition dataset, including features such as moisture content and fat percentage.

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and EDA
- Train-test split and cross-validation
- Model training and comparison:
  - Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy score
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification metrics (precision, recall, F1)

## Results
The final model achieved strong classification performance with high predictive accuracy and excellent separation between low-fat and high-fat classes.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `altair`
